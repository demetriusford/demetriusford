# The Five Tenets

**Tenet I: Skill Is Speed**

*Skill development always yields the greatest ROI. Driver errors cost more time than inadequate equipment. Invest in professional instruction and track time before considering upgrades. Your capability limits performance, not the car's specification.*

**Tenet II: Respect The Engineering**

*Honor the manufacturer's engineering. Choose OEM motorsport parts and proven aftermarket solutions over unvalidated alternatives. The platform was designed by professionals—enhance it, don't undermine it with unproven components.*

**Tenet III: Function Defines Form**

*Every modification must serve a measurable purpose: faster lap times, improved reliability, or enhanced capability. If the benefit cannot be proven through data acquisition or consistent testing, the modification is suspect.*

**Tenet IV: Balance Outperforms Excess**

*Lap times come from balance, not maximizing individual specifications. Front downforce without rear downforce creates understeer. Power without brakes extends braking zones. Weight reduction without proper distribution degrades handling. Develop all systems proportionally—single-parameter optimization guarantees slower lap times.*

**Tenet V: Data Eliminates Bias**

*Lap times, tire temperatures, and telemetry define success. Test every modification. Remove what doesn't work. Build on evidence, not trends or assumptions.*
